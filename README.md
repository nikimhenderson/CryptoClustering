# CryptoClustering
The aim of this challenge was to predict if 24 hr or 7 day price changes affect cryptocurrencies. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, including K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It also explores the impact PCA has on clustering techniques.

# Steps
1. Prepare the data (scale)
2. Find the best value for k using the original data
3. Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original data and plot
4. Optimize the clusters with PCA
5. Find the best value for k using the PCA data
6. Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data and plot
7. Visualize and compare the results

# Results
